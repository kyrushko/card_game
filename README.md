## Casino games notes 

- Starting bankroll: $1000 (see `blackjack/blackjack.py` via `DEFAULT_BANKROLL`).
- Shoe: 4 decks (208 cards). `shuffle_deck(deck)` shuffles in place. `faro_shuffle(deck)` returns a new list — use `deck = faro_shuffle(deck)` if you want the Faro result applied.
- Card values: 2–10 = face value, J/Q/K = 10, A = 1 or 11 (auto-best, handled by `hand_value`).
- Dealer rules: shows one card, reveals hidden card after player stands, hits while < 17, stands on 17 or higher.
- Betting:
  - Place bets between 1 and your current bankroll.
  - Main bet is deducted immediately when placed.
  - Press Enter at the bet prompt to reuse the last valid bet (if it still fits your bankroll).
  - Non-numeric input is rejected.
- Insurance:
  - Offered when dealer shows an Ace.
  - Costs half the main bet (integer division in code).
  - Pays 2:1 if dealer has Blackjack (stake returned + 2× payout).
- Outcomes and payouts:
  - Win → receive 2× bet (stake returned + winnings).
  - Push → stake returned.
  - Loss/bust → stake already deducted.
  - Insurance win → insurance stake returned + 2× insurance stake.
- Bust behavior:
  - If you bust, the main bet has already been removed.
  - After a bust you are prompted to play another hand unless bankroll is zero.
- Input controls:
  - Blackjack: `h` = Hit, `s` = Stand, `q` = Quit, `y`/`n` = confirm prompts.
  - Higher or Lower: `h` = Higher, `l` = Lower, `q` = Quit.
- Implementation notes / known limitations:
  - No splitting, doubling down, or multi-hand play — simplified Blackjack rules.
  - `draw_card(deck)` uses `pop(0)` (removes from front).
  - If you expect the Faro shuffle to be applied in `blackjack/blackjack.py`, change the call to `deck = faro_shuffle(deck)` (current code calls `faro_shuffle(deck)` without assignment).
  - If you observe unexpected bankroll behavior, confirm main bet deduction and payout logic in `blackjack/blackjack.py`.
